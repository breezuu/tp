# NAB User Guide

___All your NUS connections, right at your fingertips___

NUS Address Book (NAB) is a desktop application built for **NUS students** to manage contacts across multiple modules, project groups, and CCAs with ease.
It is **optimized for use** via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.
If you can type fast, NAB can help you organize and retrieve context-specific contacts and track events faster than traditional GUI apps.

Here is how NAB can **make student networking easier**:
- Store and edit contact cards for your friends
- Track events tied to contacts
- Make bulk organisation easier with tags

# Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed on your computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F08-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar NAB.jar` command to run the application.<br><br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. <br> e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>

    Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the address book.

   * `delete n/John Doe` : Deletes a contact with name 'John Doe' from the address book.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

# Features

## Quick utilities

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format in Quick Utilities:**
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.
    * e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.<br><br>
* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</box>

### Navigating command history

NAB keeps track of the commands you have entered, making it easier to reuse previous commands without typing them again.

This feature allows you to use **arrow keys** while in the command box to navigate through previously entered commands for the current session.

* Press ↑ to go back to older commands.
* Press ↓ to go forward to more recent commands.
* Pressing ↓ past the most recent history entry restores the text you were typing before you started navigating.
* Command history is session-only and is not saved after you exit NAB.

### Copying a Contact's Information

NAB allows you to copy a contact’s information, making it easier to reuse their details without typing them out manually.
A double-click on a person's contact copies their information to your clipboard.

This feature allows you to copy the displayed information of a contact for use outside NAB.

The copied text includes the following fields (optional fields that are not present are omitted):
- Name
- Phone number
- Tags
- Address
- Email

Each field is placed on a separate line.

### Viewing help: `help`

NAB provides quick access to both the online and offline versions of the User Guide, allowing you to refer to it whenever you need guidance on NAB’s features and commands.

This feature displays a message explaining how to access the online and offline help pages.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

### Exiting the program: `exit`

When it is time to say goodbye, NAB will not make it awkward.

This feature closes the program and ends the current session.

Format: `exit`

## Contact Management

</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format in Contact Management:**
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
    * e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.<br><br>
* Items in square brackets are **optional**.
    * e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.<br><br>
* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
    * e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.<br><br>
* Parameters can be in any order. (except [Assigning tag(s) to person(s)](#assigning-tag-s-to-person-s-tag))
    * e.g. if the command format specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.<br><br>
* `NAME` and `TAG` are case-insensitive.
    * `t/Friends` and `t/friends` are treated as 1 unique tag.
    * `n/aLeX YeOH` will match `Alex Yeoh`.<br><br>
* Only full words will be matched
    * e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`.
</box>

### User Disambiguation

Commands in NAB identify a contact by name. If two or more contacts share the same name,
NAB cannot determine which one you meant, and will display the following error:
<box type="important" icon=":fa-solid-exclamation-triangle:">

**ERROR MESSAGE**<br>
`Multiple matches identified! Please provide more arguments.`<br>
This error means your command matched more than one contact. No changes have been made —
retry the command with additional details to uniquely identify the contact you want.

</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Disambiguate with Optional Parameters**


Add one or more optional parameters **immediately after `n/NAME`** to narrow the match down to a single contact.

| Parameter | Prefix | Example               |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------|
| Phone number | `p/` | `p/91234567`          |
| Email address | `e/` | `e/Irene@example.com` |
| Home address | `a/` | `a/Clementi Ave 6`    |
| Tag | `t/` | `t/CS2103`            |

Supply as many parameters as needed — NAB will only proceed once exactly one contact matches all the criteria you provide.

<box theme="success" icon=":fa-solid-lightbulb:">

**TIP**

Use `find n/NAME` first to see all contacts that share a name. Their details will help you
decide which parameter to add for disambiguation.

</box>

Here is what NAB looks like when you **disambiguate duplicates:**

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="images/tag_command.png" style="width: 80%;">
</div>

* Start by listing the tag(s) using `label/...`; these tags are applied to **every** specified contact.
* After the tags, add one or more contact segments, each starting with `n/NAME`.
* Optional fields placed immediately after a contact's `n/NAME` (such as `p/`, `e/`, `a/`, `t/`) apply only to that contact.
* Do not mix tag and contact segments. All `label/...` entries must come before the first `n/...`.
* If a tag does not exist yet, NAB creates it automatically.
* If a person segment matches multiple contacts, NAB shows those matches and asks for a more specific command.

<box type="info">

**Examples**


- `tag label/CS2103 n/John Doe`<br>

</box>

### Adding an event: `event add`

Creates a new event for a specified person.

Format: `event add title/TITLE [desc/DESCRIPTION] start/START_DATE end/END_DATE n/NAME [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="images/event_add.png" style="width: 80%;">
</div>

<box type="info">

**Examples**


- `event add title/CS2109S Meeting desc/Final discussion on problem set 1 start/2026-03-25 0900 end/2026-03-25 1000 n/David Li`<br>
  Adds an event titled "CS2109S Meeting" to David Li.

- `event add title/CS2109S Meeting desc/Final discussion on problem set 1 start/2026-03-25 0900 end/2026-03-25 1000 n/David Li p/99272758`<br>
  Adds an event to the David Li with phone number `99272758`, disambiguating between multiple contacts with the same name.

</box>

<box type="important">

Event uniqueness and time clashes**


- NAB treats the event list as **your schedule** (user point of view).
- Time clashes are checked **globally** across the event list, not per contact.
  - Reason: from your point of view, one user cannot be in two places at the same time, so overlapping events are blocked.
- Overlap means the 2 ranges share actual time in common. Back-to-back events are allowed (for example, one ends at `1000` and another starts at `1000`).
- If a clash is found, NAB shows: `This event clashes with an existing event in the calendar.`

## Data and Storage

### Exporting contacts: `export`
Back up your NAB contacts in seconds so you can share, archive, or migrate your data anytime.

This `export` feature allows you to write contacts from NAB into 2 CSV files (`<FILENAME>_persons.csv` and `<FILENAME>_events.csv`).

Format: `export t/EXPORT_TYPE f/FILENAME`

<box type="info">

**Examples**


- `export t/all f/save_file`<br>
  Exports all contact information in NAB to `save_file_persons.csv` and `save_file_events.csv`.

- `export t/current f/save_file`<br>
  Exports only the currently displayed contact information to `save_file_persons.csv` and `save_file_events.csv`.

</box>


<box type="important">

**Important**


- `EXPORT_TYPE` must be either:
    - `all` (export every contact in NAB), or
    - `current` (export only the contacts currently shown in the contact list).
- Enter `FILENAME` without specifying the `_persons.csv` or `_events.csv` extension. NAB will automatically append it for you.
- The exported files are saved in the same directory as the current NAB data file.
  - If a file with the same name already exists, it will be overwritten.
- Order of parameters does not matter.

</box>

<box theme="success">

**Tip**


Use `export t/current ...` after `find` or `filter` to quickly export a specific subset of contacts.

</box>


### Importing contacts: `import`
Bring your contact data into NAB quickly when switching devices or restoring from a backup.

This `import` feature allows you to load contacts from 2 CSV files (`<FILENAME>_persons.csv` and `<FILENAME>_events.csv`) into NAB.

Format: `import t/IMPORT_TYPE f/FILENAME`


<box type="info">

**Examples**


- `import t/overwrite f/save_file`<br>
  Imports contacts from `save_file_persons.csv` and event definitions from `save_file_events.csv`, replacing the existing data on the address book.

- `import t/add f/save_file`<br>
  Imports contacts from `save_file_persons.csv` and event definitions from `save_file_events.csv`, adding them to the current address book.

</box>

<box type="important">

**Important**


- `IMPORT_TYPE` must be either:
    - `add` (adds imported data to the current address book), or
    - `overwrite` (replaces the current address book with imported data).
- Enter `FILENAME` without specifying the `_persons.csv` or `_events.csv` extension, as NAB automatically looks for the 2 CSV files belonging to the specified `FILENAME`.
- The CSV files must be placed in the same directory as the current NAB data file.
- Contacts in the CSV file that already exist in NAB are skipped to avoid duplicates.
- Rows with invalid or missing required fields are skipped.
- Order of parameters does not matter.

</box>

<box theme="success">

**Tip**


If you are unsure, run `import t/add ...` first to avoid accidental data loss. Use `import t/overwrite ...` only when you want a full replacement.

</box>


### Saving the data
Focus on managing your contacts! NAB does the heavy lifting by saving your data automatically in the background.

<box theme="success">

**Tip**


- There is no manual save command in NAB.
- If a command succeeds, your latest data is already persistent in the data file.

</box>

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="important">

**Important**


- If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.
- If your changes to the data file make its data inconsistent, NAB will first attempt to repair it automatically. If the inconsistency cannot be resolved, NAB will clear the entire address book to maintain data integrity.
- Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g. if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

</box>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
